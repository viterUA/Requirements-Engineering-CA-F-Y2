# Requirements Engineering CA F Y2

This repository contains coursework for the Requirements Engineering module (CA F) in Year 2 of the Software Engineering program at \[University Name]. The project focuses on applying requirements engineering principles to a real-world software system, encompassing the full spectrum from stakeholder analysis to system specification.

## Project Overview

The goal of this coursework is to:

* Conduct comprehensive requirements elicitation and analysis.
* Develop detailed user and system requirements documents.
* Apply industry-standard tools and methodologies to ensure clarity and traceability.

## Repository Contents

* **SD\_RE\_Hnylytskyi\_Mykhailo.docx**: The primary system requirements document detailing functional and non-functional requirements.
* **PJ\_RE\_MykhailoHnylytskyi**: A folder containing project-related artifacts, including diagrams, models, and supporting materials.
* **.vs**: Visual Studio solution directory, indicating the use of C# for prototyping or related development tasks.

## Methodology

The project follows a structured approach to requirements engineering, incorporating best practices such as:

* **Stakeholder Interviews**: Engaging with end-users and domain experts to gather insights.
* **Use Case Modeling**: Defining system interactions to capture functional requirements.
* **Quality Function Deployment (QFD)**: Translating customer needs into technical specifications.
* **UML Diagrams**: Visualizing system architecture and workflows.
